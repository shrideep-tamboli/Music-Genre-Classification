# Music-Genre-Classification
This is a DeepLearning Major Project on Music Genre Classification using GTZAN dataset.<br/>
# About the GTZAN dataset:
[GTZAN](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) dataset is a pre-processed dataset with extracted features (for example; fast-fourier transformation, short-time-fourier transformation, MFCCs, etc) from .wav/audio files as images on 10 different music genres with 100 audio files each genre, making it a 10,000 X 60 (row X column) dataset presented by kaggle (in my knowledge).<br/>
# About the classification model:
I've used CNN algorithm with a [Sequential]([url](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/)) model to classify the GTZAN dataset
